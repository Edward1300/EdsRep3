------------------
**The 3 files here are 3 of the assignments I did in Intro to MAGD. They are as follows:**
## Assignment 7
Assignment 7 is a visual of a pixelated crab bouncing around the screen moving extremely fast. During this, a print command counts up continuously in the console.
## Assignment 8
Assignment 8 is a bunch of moving images, including 2 cats, a GIF of a skull rotating, as well as some text displaying a greeting.
## Assignment 10
Assignment 10 is a couple of experiments with a p5.js library that creates 3D text and shapes. As well as creating text and shapes, I translated a piece of art that I had created into a 3d object using one of the functions of the program.
